## Engineering Values

### We are crafts-people
- We learn to grow in our craft and dedicate time to learning
- We make decisions consciously rather than slinging code
- We build in quality through high test coverage, strong typing, and dog-fooding the things we build
- We believe in pragmatic programming


### Perfect is the enemy of done, and sloppy is the enemy of our customers and colleagues
- We prioritize pragmatic delivery of our work. Our job is to help the company succeed, and part of that is making trade-offs.
- We never make trade-offs that include:
    - Introducing significant technical debt to the detriment of our future engineering efforts
    - Significantly decreasing test coverage of core functionality
    - Introducing security vulnerabilities or leaking data
    - Significantly increasing delivery timelines for the sake of standing by "best tool for the job". 
    > The problem with “best tool for the job” thinking is that it takes a myopic view of the words “best” and “job.” Your job is keeping the company in business, g** d*** it. And the “best” tool is the one that occupies the “least worst” position for as many of your problems as possible - from [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology#:~:text=The%20problem%20with%20%E2%80%9Cbest%20tool,of%20your%20problems%20as%20possible).


### Take a break
It's easy to get overwhelmed with a level of cognitive load given the nature of our work. We benefit when we step away and take breaks, or switch to a less heavy task.


### New isn't always better, but old isn't always right


### We Succeed Together
Every person is a member of the team, and should never feel alone. We are here to help one another through pairing, mentoring, and teaching.

### A Blameless Environment
We don't seek to blame people when things go wrong. We look to move fast and fix things, assess, then learn so it doesn't happen again.

### Continually Improve
We think innovation comes from people who do the work. So we seek to continually improve our processes by sharing knowledge routinely and communicating the things that work best for us.

### We are the culture
Each of us individually share a part in maintaining and setting the engineering culture. Therefore we must model the behavior that we wish to see.
